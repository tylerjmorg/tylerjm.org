Definitions
-----------
Qty:
   Quantity (Qty) of the exact same record in the inventory. The 
   record must be exactly the same as the other(s) and must have the 
   same column properties. A "0" quantity (Qty) indicates that a 
   record used to belong in the inventory but has changed possession 
   willfully (e.g., sold or gifted).

Disc Color(s):
   To signify different types of disc. (e.g., "Target Exclusive 
   (Blue)" or "Walmart Exclusive (Transparent)"). The disc color(s) 
   only are okay to add as well, (e.g., "Clear" or "Apricot").

Disc Count:
   The number of discs contained within the specific record.

Contents Count:
   All contents in the originally purchased record, including any 
   original sleeve(s), jacket(s), digital download slips, posters, 
   booklets, hype stickers, and other bonus content. Post-sale sleeves 
   or any aftermarket items will not be counted. The contents count 
   excludes the disc(s).








Contents Description(s):
   The quantity and brief description of all original contents 
   contained within one  record, including any original sleeve(s), 
   jacket(s), digital download slips, posters, booklets, hype 
   stickers, and other bonus content. Post-sale sleeves or any 
   aftermarket items will not be counted. The contents count excludes 
   the disc(s). The contents description must equal the contents count 
   column.

Discogs Release Code:
   Identifies the specific record on <https://www.discogs.com>. 
   Searching the release code brings up all information regarding the 
   specific record.

Goldmine Condition(s):
   Each disc(s) and jacket(s)' condition according to The Goldmine 
   Grading Guide. URL: 
   <https://www.goldminemag.com/collector-resources/record-
   grading-101>. 
   Each disc and jacket must be graded individually. Acceptable 
   grades: M, NM, VG+, VG, G+, G, F, P.

Listened:
   A Boolean value identifying if all tracks on a specific record have 
   been played and listened to in its entirety. All quantities must be 
   listened to, i.e., if the "Qty" column is 3, all three records must 
   be listened to in their entirety, even though they are the same 
   tracks.

Digital Download(s):
   A Yes, No, or N/A value indicating if a digital format of the exact 
   same record was downloaded. The digital download must include the 
   same album name and the same and/or more tracks as the physical 
   record (excluding hidden tracks). "No" value means that there 
   exists a buyable download that meets the "Yes" value requirements 
   but has not been purchased. "N/A" value means that there is no 
   existing buyable download that meets the "Yes" value requirements. 
   "Yes" value requirements: 1. The download must contain at least a 
   FLAC or WAV original file for all tracks. 2. The download has to be 
   an official download from the label, artist, or a trusted 3rd 
   party. 3. The download must be a portable file (i.e., not 
   downloaded from iTunes or another proprietary store). 4. The proof 
   of purchase (PoP) (digital download slips are okay) must be stored 
   safely alongside the music file(s) in cloud storage. 5. All files, 
   including all music files and PoPs, must be stored in at least two 
   different cloud storage providers for resilience.
